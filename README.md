# VITEWINDS SCRIPT/S

ViteWinds is a simple little script I crafted to help increase my productivity for completing full stack projects for a class I was taking. Hopefully someone else finds this script helpful as much as I did.

# Installation

Just clone the repo

```
 git clone git@github.com:Douglas-Green/ViteWinds.git
```

cd into the cloned directory

```
cd /ViteWinds
```

I made two versions as I sometimes like to use my linux machine
and of course my windows machine

```
config.ps1 = windows machine
```

```
setup.sh = Debian/Bash
```

Once you have chosen your version simply run the script

**Bash/Debian command**

```
./setup.sh
```

**Powershell command**

```
./config.ps1
```

**Known issues !?!?!?**

```
There was a small 🐞🐞🐞 I couldn't figure out how to solve.
 When the script is about to finish up its task, I wanted to remove the no longer needed
files/folders from the project. I could not get it to remove the assets folder.
 Other than that the script should work as intended. Feel free to reach out if you have any issues or questions
 If you found this script helpful please leave a star and a follow for more scripts in the future. Thanks! 😎
